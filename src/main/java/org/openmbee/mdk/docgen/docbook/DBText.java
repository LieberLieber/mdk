/**
 * This is a bit like DBParagraph, but will not force it into a paragraph. <br/>
 * You can put in plain text, html, or docbook in a DBText. <br/>
 * If you want your document to look right on the view editor, then don't put
 * any docbook tags in here. You can use html to achieve styles like bold,
 * italics, underline etc, and DocGen will process them according to which
 * destination it's generating for. <br/>
 * You can still put in verbatim docbook, but there's no guarantee they will
 * show up in the view editor. If all you need is docbook output or have your
 * document on DocWeb, then that's ok.
